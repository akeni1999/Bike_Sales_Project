# Bike_Sales_Project

### Situation

The goal of the project was to uncover trends and patterns and make data-driven decisions to make understand the target market for the bike business.

### Task

I aimed to build the dashboard using Excel and perform data preprocessing like removing duplicates, replacing null values, and transforming the data for analysis. The goal was to display key metrics like average income, gender, age, and customer commute to understand how the business is performing overall and give analysis based on marital status, region, and education.

### Action

I have developed the Dashboard in Excel where I have performed analysis on the following factors:

- **Average Income Analysis:** I have developed interactive graphs that showcase the average income of individuals who have purchased bikes, categorized by gender and whether they own a bike or not. This data provides valuable insights into the relationship between income levels and bike ownership, helping businesses target their marketing efforts more effectively.
- **Commuting Distance Visualization:** Using dynamic charts, I have visualized the commuting distance of bike riders. This information can be filtered by region, providing an in-depth understanding of the geographic distribution and preferences of bike commuters. These insights can inform decisions related to product placement, marketing campaigns, and infrastructure development.
- **Bike Purchases by Age:** Another valuable aspect of my dashboard is the inclusion of graphs that present the count of bike purchases according to age groups. By leveraging slicers for marital status and education, users can explore the demographics of bike buyers within specific segments, enabling businesses to tailor their offerings to specific target markets.

### Result

- In the Pacific region, the average income for male bike buyers is higher than that of female bike buyers.
- When considering marital status, we notice that married males tend to have a higher average income compared to single males. Moreover, education level also plays a significant role, with higher education correlating with higher average incomes in both genders.
- In the Pacific region, we observe that individuals who are married tend to have longer average commuting distances on bikes. This indicates that these individuals may perceive biking as a feasible and convenient mode of transportation for longer distances.
- In terms of age, we can see that the majority of bike purchases are made by individuals in the Middle age bracket ( 30 yrs - 55 yrs ). However, as we apply different filters, we uncover interesting variations.
- Education level seems to influence bike purchases, with higher education corresponding to a lower likelihood of buying a bike within each age bracket.
